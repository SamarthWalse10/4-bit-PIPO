# 4-bit-PIPO-Verilog
4-bit Parallel Input Parallel Output Register (PIPO) Design in Verilog.     

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a 4-bit Parallel Input Parallel Output (PIPO) register using D flip-flops. The project focuses on designing and simulating a digital circuit that can store and transfer binary data in parallel mode.
## Overview
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a 4-bit Parallel Input Parallel Output (PIPO) register using Verilog hardware description language (HDL). The PIPO register is a type of storage device capable of loading and retrieving data in parallel mode.
The implementation is done in Verilog hardware description language (HDL).
Simulation and testing were performed using Xilinx Vivado 2021.2.
## Contents
The src directory contains the Verilog source code for the 4-bit PIPO.
The sim directory includes the simulation files and test bench code.
## Usage
1. Clone the repository: 
    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/SamarthWalse10/4-bit-PIPO.git
2. Open the project in your preferred Verilog development environment.
3. Compile and synthesize the Verilog source code.
4. Simulate the design using the provided test bench.
5. Analyze the simulation results and verify the functionality of the 4-bit PIPO.
